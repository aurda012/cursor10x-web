# Cursor10x Website

## Technology/Framework Stack:

- React 18
- Nextjs 14+
- shadcn-ui
- Google Gemini API using Gemini 2.5 Pro

## Breakdown and User Flow:

One “landing page” which is just the chat view. No authentication or extra pages for now. As soon as it loads there will be a introduction message for the user on the chat that introduces itself as the Cursor10x agent that is going to help get their project up and running with everything to supercharge their Cursor AI experience and usage. The initial conversation does not need any help from the A.I. - it is a series of questions we will ask to build and gather all the information we need to fill in our ready to go templated prompt which we will feed to the A.I. once we finish our series of questions. We need to persist all of the answers from the user to fill out the templated prompts piece by piece (each question fills out one of the needed parts of the prompt) and also to show it in the chat history. After a series of prompts and responses to/from the A.I. we will have gathered a technical blueprint, file/folder architecture, implementation guide, and tasks file.

### 1. Introduction Message/Question

Message: “Hello there! I’m one of the Cursor10x agents and I’m going to help get your project up and running with everything to supercharge your Cursor AI experience and usage. By the end of our conversation, you will have a ready to go zip file that will include the following for your project:

- An in-depth Technical Blueprint
- A fully implemented folder/file architecture
- An implementation guide
- All tasks needed to create the production ready version of their project
- The entire Cursor10x system that includes a multi-agent team with memory persistence, inter-agent communication, and ready to go task management workflow

Now let’s get started… What’s shall we name your project?”

Response: Project Name

### 2. Project Overview

Message: Please provide me with a high-level overview of your project. Explain what problem(s) it solves, who it's for, and why it's valuable.

Response: Project Overview

### 3. Core Features

Message: Awesome! Next, can you give me a list of the main features of your product. For each feature, please include a detailed explanation of what it does and how it works at a high level. Remember to hold down the shift key + return to go to a new line.

Response: List of detailed features

### 4. UI/UX

Message: Now can you please describe the user interface/front-end and user experience. Include any details you can think of in terms of the UI/UX for the project.

Response: UI/UX breakdown

### 5. Technical Architecture

Message: Finally, can you provide me with all the details you can think of in terms of the technical implementation and requirements for your project - things such as:

- Coding Language(s)
- Libraries, platforms and dependencies
- Database(s) and Data models
- APIs and integrations
- Infrastructure requirements

Response: Technical Architecture

### 6. End of Initial Questions

Message: Perfect! Now I will begin the journey of creating your technical blueprint, file/folder architecture, implementation guide and all tasks. Please be patient as this is gonna take some processing time from the A.I.! I’ll showcase previews as they are done being made. Just a minute and you’ll be on your way with your next-level Cursor AI implementation.

### 7. Technical Blueprint Creation

Now we will provide the prompt we built up from all the responses to the A.I. model to get it to create our technical blueprint first. We should showcase it to the user as it starts responding as a stream in the special Artifacts feature/version of the chat. We need to make sure we show loading states and proper feedback on processing. We also need to prevent from the user inputting any responses while this is being processed.

### 8. File/Folder Architecture Creation

Once the technical blueprint is done, we will showcase quick intermission message letting the user know we are now moving on to the file/folder architecture. Now we will provide the technical blueprint back to the A.I. (maybe we don’t need to if its cached in the conversation/chat with it) and attach another prompt for the A.I. to create the file/folder architecture. We will follow the same process and start showcasing the architecture response from the A.I. as a stream into the chat. Once it’s done we provide another friendly message to the user saying we are now moving on to creating the implementation guide.

### 9. Implementation Guide Creation

Now we provide the A.I. with a prompt to create the full implementation guide for the project based off of the file/folder architecture which will include a breakdown of every file in the project in the proper order of execution to create the entire project from start to finish. We will stream this response back to the user as well and provide another friendly message saying we are on to our final “task” which is actually creating the tasks!

### 10. Tasks Creation

Now we provide the A.I. with a prompt to help create per-file tasks in the proper order of execution based on the implementation guide. Each task will include an ID, title, file name/path for the file that needs to be worked on, file name of the individual task file we will be creating, status which will be set to pending originally, and finally an extremely in-depth prompt for the A.I. agents within Cursor A.I. to help create/develop that said task/file. We can stream these into a message in the chat.

### 11. Putting it All Together

We need to make a system that will not only stream the responses for each of the things we are creating but also make and save individual files for each (technical blueprint, architecture, implementation guide and tasks) and break store them internally until we have them all ready to go and return not only all of those files but also the Cursor10x project all zipped into one .zip file and return it to the user so they can download it.

## UI/UX

### Overview

One main page with a chat interface that will be used to gather information from the user and display the responses from the A.I. as well as the generated artifacts previews. It should use shadcn/ui components for the chat interface and the chat should be responsive and mobile friendly. It should have the ability to show markdown previews of the generated artifacts and JSON previews of the tasks.

## Tech Stack

- Nextjs 14+
- shadcn-ui
- Google Gemini API using Gemini 2.5 Pro
- No need for database

Okay, acting as an expert software architect and technical writer, here is an exhaustive technical blueprint for the Cursor10x Web App project, incorporating research, best practices, and optimizing the provided details.

## Cursor10x Web Technical Blueprint

### **1. Executive Summary**

The Cursor10x Web is a single-page application designed to streamline the initial setup phase for software projects intended to be developed using the Cursor AI code editor. Its primary purpose is to guide users through a structured conversation, gathering essential project details (name, overview, features, UI/UX, technical stack). This information is then used to dynamically generate a comprehensive set of project artifacts via the Google Gemini AI model. These artifacts include a technical blueprint, a file/folder architecture, an implementation guide, and a structured list of development tasks. The final output is a downloadable zip archive containing these generated documents along with a pre-packaged "Cursor10x system" (a multi-agent framework template) designed to accelerate development within the Cursor environment.

**Problem Solved:** The app addresses the often time-consuming and unstructured process of initial project planning and setup, especially when leveraging AI-assisted development tools like Cursor. It provides a standardized, guided workflow to ensure all necessary foundational elements are considered and documented.

**Value Proposition:**

- **Accelerated Project Kick-off:** Significantly reduces the time required to define project structure and initial tasks.
- **Enhanced Cursor AI Integration:** Provides artifacts specifically formatted to maximize the effectiveness of Cursor's AI features (e.g., detailed task prompts for AI agents).
- **Structured Planning:** Enforces a consistent process for gathering requirements and defining architecture.
- **Standardized Output:** Delivers a consistent set of foundational documents for any project initiated through the app.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple, conversational interface requires no prior setup or complex configuration.

**Expected Outcomes:** Users receive a ready-to-use zip file containing a technical blueprint, file structure, implementation guide, task list, and the Cursor10x multi-agent system template, enabling them to immediately start focused development within Cursor.

- **FR-10: Streaming Response Display:** Display AI-generated content (artifacts) progressively (streaming) within the chat interface, potentially in a designated "Artifacts" view. (Priority: High)
- **FR-11: Loading/Processing Indicators:** Provide clear visual feedback to the user during AI processing times (e.g., loading spinners, status messages). (Priority: High)
- **FR-12: Input Disabling:** Prevent user input while AI generation is in progress. (Priority: High)
- **FR-13: Intermission Messages:** Display brief, user-friendly messages between the generation steps of different artifacts. (Priority: Medium)
- **FR-14: Artifact Storage:** Temporarily store the generated artifact content (e.g., Markdown text) within the application's backend or state. (Priority: High)
- **FR-15: Task Formatting:** Ensure generated tasks adhere to the specified format (ID, Title, File Path, Task File Name, Status=Pending, Detailed Prompt). (Priority: High)
- **FR-16: Zip File Creation:** Package all generated artifact files (e.g., `technical_blueprint.md`, `architecture.txt`, `implementation_guide.md`, `tasks.json`/individual task files) and the pre-defined Cursor10x system template into a single zip archive. (Priority: High)
- **FR-17: File Download:** Provide a mechanism for the user to download the generated zip file. (Priority: High)
- **FR-18: Cursor10x System Inclusion:** Include a static, pre-defined set of files representing the "Cursor10x system" template within the final zip file. (Priority: High)

#### **2.2. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **NFR-01: Performance:**
  - Chat interface interactions should feel instantaneous (<200ms response).
  - AI generation time will depend on Gemini API, but the UI must remain responsive with clear progress indication. Aim for streaming to start within 5-10 seconds of request initiation.
- **NFR-02: Usability:**
  - The chat interface must be intuitive and easy to follow.
  - Instructions and messages should be clear and concise.
  - Error handling (e.g., for API failures) must provide user-friendly feedback.
- **NFR-03: Reliability:**
  - The application should reliably handle the conversation flow and state management.
  - API interactions should include error handling and potential retry mechanisms for transient issues.
- **NFR-04: Scalability:**
  - While initially designed for single-user sessions, the backend infrastructure (Next.js on Vercel/similar) should handle moderate concurrent user load. The primary bottleneck will be the Gemini API rate limits and processing time.
- **NFR-05: Security:**
  - API keys (Gemini) must be securely stored on the backend and not exposed to the client.
  - Basic input sanitization should be performed on user input before sending it to the AI to prevent prompt injection, although the risk is lower in this guided context.
- **NFR-06: Maintainability:**
  - Code should be well-structured, commented, and follow established React/Next.js best practices.
  - Modular design should facilitate updates and feature additions.

### **3. Solution Architecture**

#### **3.1. Architectural Style**

A **Client-Server Architecture** using a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** pattern for the frontend, communicating with **Serverless Functions** (Next.js API Routes) for backend logic and AI interaction.

#### **3.2. High-Level Architecture Diagram**

        D
        F
        G
    end

    subgraph "External Services"
        E
    end
```

#### **3.3. Component Breakdown & Interaction**

1.  **Frontend (React/Next.js):**

    - `pages/index.js`: Main page component, orchestrates the chat view.
    - `components/ChatWindow.jsx`: Container for the chat messages.
    - `components/MessageBubble.jsx`: Renders individual messages (user, agent, system).
    - `components/ChatInput.jsx`: Handles user input, including multi-line support and submission logic. Disables input during AI processing.
    - `components/ArtifactViewer.jsx`: (Optional, could be integrated into MessageBubble) Displays streamed AI responses, potentially with specific formatting for code blocks or lists.
    - `components/LoadingIndicator.jsx`: Visual feedback during processing.
    - `hooks/useChatState.js`: Custom hook to manage conversation history, user answers, AI processing status, and generated artifacts state (e.g., using `useState`, `useReducer`, or a lightweight state management library like Zustand/Jotai).
    - `lib/apiClient.js`: Utility functions for making requests to the Next.js API routes.

2.  **Backend (Next.js API Routes):**

    - `pages/api/generate/[artifact].js`: A dynamic API route to handle generation requests for different artifacts (e.g., `/api/generate/blueprint`, `/api/generate/architecture`).
      - Receives user answers and potentially previous artifacts as context.
      - Constructs the appropriate prompt for the Gemini API.
      - Calls the Gemini API securely (using environment variables for the API key).
      - Handles streaming responses back to the frontend if possible, or sends complete responses.
      - Includes robust error handling for API calls.
    - `pages/api/package.js`:
      - Receives the final generated content for all artifacts.
      - Retrieves the static Cursor10x system template files.
      - Uses a library (like `jszip`) to create a zip archive in memory or temporarily on the serverless filesystem.
      - Sends the zip file back to the client with appropriate headers for download.

3.  **External Services:**
    - **Google Gemini API:** The AI service used for generating content. Requires secure API key management.

#### **3.4. Modular Design Recommendations**

- **UI Components:** Utilize Shadcn/UI primitives and compose them into application-specific components (ChatWindow, MessageBubble, etc.). Keep components focused on presentation and delegate logic via props and callbacks.
- **State Management:** Isolate chat state logic within a custom hook (`useChatState`) or a dedicated state store (Zustand/Jotai) to decouple it from UI components.
- **API Interaction:** Centralize all backend communication within `lib/apiClient.js` or similar utility functions.
- **AI Logic:** Encapsulate prompt construction and Gemini API interaction logic within the respective API route handlers (`/api/generate/[artifact].js`). Avoid mixing AI logic directly into frontend components.
- **Artifact Generation:** Each generation step should be triggered independently via separate API calls, allowing for modularity and clear separation of concerns.
- **Packaging Logic:** Isolate zip file creation logic within the `/api/package.js` route.
- **Static Assets:** Store the Cursor10x system template files in a designated directory (e.g., `public/cursor10x_template` or `server/templates`) accessible by the packaging API route.

#### **3.5. API Specifications (Internal Next.js API)**

- **Endpoint:** `/api/generate/[artifact]`

  - **Method:** POST
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "userAnswers": {
        "projectName": "...",
        "projectOverview": "...",
        "coreFeatures": "...",
        "uiUx": "...",
        "techArchitecture": "..."
      },
      "previousContext": {
        // Optional, e.g., send blueprint when requesting architecture
        "technicalBlueprint": "..."
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Response (Streaming Preferred):** `Content-Type: text/plain` (or `application/jsonl` for structured streams) containing the generated artifact content chunk by chunk.
  - **Response (Non-streaming):** `Content-Type: application/json`
    ```json
    {
      "artifactContent": "Generated content..."
    }
    ```
  - **Error Response:** `Status: 4xx/5xx`, `Content-Type: application/json`
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Error message description"
    }
    ```

- **Endpoint:** `/api/package`
  - **Method:** POST
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
      "artifacts": {
        "technicalBlueprint": "...",
        "fileArchitecture": "...",
        "implementationGuide": "...",
        "tasks": [
          /* array of task objects or structured text */
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Response:** `Content-Type: application/zip`, `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="[projectName]_cursor10x_package.zip"` containing the zipped files.
  - **Error Response:** `Status: 4xx/5xx`, `Content-Type: application/json`
    ```json
    {
      "error": "Error message description"
    }
    ```

#### **3.6. Data Persistence & State Management**

- **Client-Side State:** React state (`useState`, `useReducer`, or Zustand/Jotai) will manage the chat history, current user inputs, AI processing status, and temporarily store the content of generated artifacts before packaging. State is ephemeral and lost on page refresh unless persisted to `localStorage` (though not a strict requirement for MVP).
- **Server-Side State:** Primarily stateless. API routes process requests based on the input provided. No database is required for this initial scope. Temporary storage might be needed for zip creation depending on the hosting environment's filesystem capabilities.

#### **3.7. Infrastructure Dependency Map**

```mermaid

#### **5.3. Wireframes / Mockups (Conceptual Description)**

- **Layout:** A centered, fixed-height Card component taking up most of the viewport.
- **Chat Area:** Inside the card, a ScrollArea displays chat bubbles (alternating alignment for user/agent). Agent messages might have a distinct background or avatar.
- **Input Area:** Below the ScrollArea, a Textarea input field with a Submit button (or icon button).
- **Artifact Display:** AI-generated content streams into new message bubbles, potentially styled differently (e.g., with a light grey background or within a collapsible section) and using code block formatting where appropriate.
- **Loading State:** Input area is disabled, and a clear message with a spinner is shown (e.g., "Cursor10x agent is thinking... Generating Blueprint").
- **Download State:** After completion, a prominent Button or link appears, labelled "Download Project Package (.zip)".

### **6. Validation Plan**

#### **6.1. Testing Strategies**

- **Unit Testing (Jest / React Testing Library):**
  - Test individual React components (rendering, props handling).
  - Test state management logic within custom hooks or stores.
  - Test utility functions (e.g., API client request formatting).
- **Integration Testing (Jest / React Testing Library / Mock Service Worker):**

### **7. Risk Management**

| Risk ID | Risk Description                         | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                    |
| :------ | :--------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R-01    | Gemini API Unavailability / Errors       | Medium     | High   | Implement robust error handling, retry mechanisms for transient errors, clear user feedback. Monitor API status.       |
| R-02    | Inaccurate/Low-Quality AI Output         | Medium     | Medium | Clearly state that output is AI-generated and may need review. Refine prompts iteratively based on testing.            |
| R-03    | Gemini API Rate Limits Exceeded          | Low        | Medium | Implement client-side checks or potentially backend rate limiting if usage grows. Monitor API usage quotas.            |
| R-04    | Gemini API Cost Overruns                 | Medium     | Medium | Monitor API costs closely. Implement usage limits if necessary. Consider efficiency improvements in prompt design.     |

### **8. Configuration Management**

- **Version Control:** Git. Repository hosted on GitHub or GitLab.
- **Branching Strategy:** Gitflow (or a simpler variant like GitHub Flow). `main` branch for production releases, `develop` for integration, feature branches for new development (`feature/`), bugfix branches (`bugfix/`).
- **Dependency Management:** `npm` or `yarn` for managing Node.js packages. Use `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to lock dependency versions. Regularly update dependencies.
- **Environment Variables:** Use `.env.local` for local development secrets (Gemini API Key) - **add `.env.local` to `.gitignore`**. Use hosting provider's environment variable management (e.g., Vercel Environment Variables) for production and preview deployments. Define variables like `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **Release Management:** Use semantic versioning (e.g., `v1.0.0`). Tag releases in Git. Deployments triggered automatically via CI/CD pipeline upon merges to `main` (production) or `develop` (staging/preview).

---

### **9. Tools and Technologies**

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript (Strongly Recommended)
- **Frontend Framework:** React 18
- **Meta-Framework:** Next.js 14+ (handles routing, SSR/SSG, API routes, optimization)
- **UI Library:** Shadcn/UI
- **State Management:** Zustand or Jotai (lightweight options suitable for this scope)
- **AI Service:** Google Gemini API (via `@google/generative-ai` npm package)
- **Backend Runtime:** Node.js (as managed by Vercel/Next.js)
- **Zip Archiving:** `jszip` npm package
- **Development Tools:**
  - IDE: VS Code
  - Package Manager: npm or yarn
  - Version Control: Git / GitHub / GitLab
- **Testing:**
  - Unit/Integration: Jest, React Testing Library
  - E2E: Cypress or Playwright
  - Mocking: Mock Service Worker (for API mocking)
- **Deployment/Hosting:** Vercel (ideal for Next.js) or similar platforms (Netlify, AWS Amplify)
- **CI/CD:** Vercel CI/CD, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI

### **10. Security Architecture**

- **Authentication:** None in the current scope.
- **Authorization:** None in the current scope (all users have the same permissions).
- **API Key Security:**
  - The Google Gemini API key MUST be stored securely as an environment variable on the server-side (Next.js API routes / Vercel environment variables).
  - The API key MUST NOT be included in frontend code or exposed to the browser.
  - API routes act as a proxy, protecting the key.
- **Input Validation/Sanitization:**
  - Perform basic sanitization on user input _before_ sending it to the Gemini API to mitigate potential prompt injection risks, although the constrained nature of the input reduces this risk. Libraries like `dompurify` (if input might contain HTML) or simple string manipulation might be sufficient.
- **Transport Layer Security:** All communication between the client browser and the Next.js application (hosted on Vercel/similar) must be over HTTPS (typically handled automatically by modern hosting providers). Communication between Next.js API routes and the Google Gemini API must also use HTTPS (default for the client library).
- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Consider basic rate limiting on the API routes (`/api/generate/*`, `/api/package`) if abuse becomes a concern, although likely unnecessary initially. Can be implemented using libraries like `rate-limiter-flexible`.
- **Dependency Security:** Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using `npm audit` or `yarn audit` and update promptly.
- **Data Handling:** No sensitive user data is stored persistently. Session data (user answers) is handled ephemerally. Ensure no accidental logging of potentially sensitive details within user input, although the prompts are non-personal.

## **Best Practices Integration**

1.  **Iterative Development:** The phased roadmap allows for building, testing, and refining functionality iteratively, incorporating feedback (even if initially internal) at each stage. The MVP focuses on the core value proposition.
2.  **Stakeholder Collaboration:** While initial requirements are defined, continuous (internal) review against the project goals acts as stakeholder alignment. If released publicly, incorporate user feedback loops.
3.  **Clear API Definitions:** Defining the internal API structure (Sec 3.5) ensures clear contracts between the frontend and backend logic.
4.  **Modular Design:** Emphasized throughout the architecture (Sec 3.4) to promote maintainability, testability, and ease of future expansion.
5.  **Secure by Design:** Security considerations (API key handling, HTTPS) are integrated early in the blueprint (Sec 10).
6.  **Automated Testing:** The validation plan (Sec 6) includes unit, integration, and E2E tests, crucial for maintaining quality in an iterative process.
7.  **CI/CD:** Leveraging CI/CD pipelines (Sec 8 & 9) ensures consistent builds, testing, and deployments.
8.  **AI Interaction Management:** Treat AI interaction as a critical component with specific considerations for prompt engineering, error handling, streaming, and cost management.
