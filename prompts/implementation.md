Can you now create an "implementation guide" based on the above architecture diagram we created that includes every single file we may need to create in order from the start of the development process all the way through the final product (fully finished project). Please review the blueprint we also created for context as well. Please include an explanation/details that may be important to understand for each step in the implementation guide. Break it down into phases or a proper organizational structure. Do not overlook anything or any aspect of the project.
