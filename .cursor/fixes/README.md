# Cursor Extensions - Fixes

This directory contains fixes and enhancements for the Cursor extensions system.

## Enhanced Compatibility Module

**File:** `enhance-compatibility.js`  
**Version:** 1.0.0

### Purpose

The Enhanced Compatibility Module extends the base System Compatibility Layer by fixing issues that cause systems to show as "PARTIAL" status in banners. It implements missing methods and functionality to ensure all core systems show as "ACTIVE" in their respective banners.

### Key Features

1. **Memory System Enhancement**

   - Adds a robust storage mechanism for in-memory data
   - Implements working `storeContext` and `getContext` methods
   - Self-tests to verify functionality

2. **Scratchpad System Enhancement**

   - Creates a message storage array if missing
   - Implements a fully functional `createMessage` method
   - Handles backward compatibility with existing methods

3. **Integration with Centralized Init**

   - Automatically loaded by centralized-init.js
   - Re-applied after system initialization to ensure all methods work
   - Updates banners to reflect improved system status

4. **Banner Refreshing**
   - Attempts to refresh banners after fixes are applied
   - Loads banner system if not already loaded

### Usage

The module is automatically loaded by the centralized initialization system. You don't need to manually include it.

To use it in a custom script:

```javascript
// Load the enhanced compatibility module
require("../fixes/enhance-compatibility.js");

// Force the layer to be applied again
if (typeof globalThis.enhanceCompatibilityLayer === "function") {
  globalThis.enhanceCompatibilityLayer();
}

// Refresh banners to show updated status
if (
  globalThis.BANNER_SYSTEM &&
  typeof globalThis.BANNER_SYSTEM.forceBanners === "function"
) {
  globalThis.BANNER_SYSTEM.forceBanners();
}
```

### Testing

To verify that the enhanced compatibility is working:

1. Run the centralized initialization:

   ```
   node .cursor/centralized-init.js
   ```

2. Check if the banners show "ACTIVE" for all systems:

   ```
   üß† [MEMORY SYSTEM: ACTIVE]
   üìù [SCRATCHPAD SYSTEM: ACTIVE]
   ```

3. Or run the test script:
   ```
   node .cursor/test-enhanced-compatibility.js
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If systems still show as "PARTIAL" after applying the enhanced compatibility:

1. Make sure the `fixes` directory exists and contains `enhance-compatibility.js`
2. Check that the centralized-init.js has been updated to load the enhanced module
3. Try running the centralized initialization with verbose logging enabled:
   ```
   DEBUG=true node .cursor/centralized-init.js
   ```
4. Check the activation status:
   ```
   cat .cursor/activation-status.js
   ```

### Future Improvements

- [ ] Add support for Multi-Agent System method enhancements
- [ ] Improve database integration for Memory System
- [ ] Add thread management functionality to Scratchpad System
- [ ] Create auto-repair function to detect and fix system issues
