# Artifact Streaming Implementation Plan

## Current Approach

We've simplified the ArtifactViewer and ChatWindow components to focus on core functionality:

1. **ArtifactViewer**: Streamlined to efficiently read from streams and display content

   - Removed debouncing to simplify the implementation
   - Simplified error handling while maintaining essential checks
   - Maintained support for markdown, JSON, and plain text rendering

2. **ChatWindow**: Simplified to focus on basic UI structure
   - Uses the existing ChatMessages component for messages
   - Shows live stream preview when an artifact is being generated
   - Each artifact type (blueprint, architecture, guide, tasks) will appear properly in the chat

## Display Flow

1. User submits a prompt
2. AI begins generating artifacts (blueprint, architecture, guide, tasks) one at a time
3. Each artifact appears first as a streaming preview below the messages
4. When complete, the artifact content is added to the messages array via the onComplete callback
5. Previous artifacts appear embedded in messages while the current one streams in the preview area

## Next Steps

1. Verify the simplified stream reading approach works with Gemini API
2. Test multiple artifact instances display correctly in sequence
3. Fine-tune appearance of artifact previews within messages
4. Add styling enhancements only after core functionality is verified
