Now can you help create all possible needed tasks for creating this project from start to finish?

Please follow the following structure (it's a JSON file):

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "001",
      "title": "Initialize Project Structure",
      "file": "package.json",
      "status": "pending",
      "prompt": "Based on the architecture.md file, please create the basic folder structure and essential configuration files for the project. This should include all primary directories, package.json with initial dependencies, and configuration files for build tools. Ensure the structure aligns with the architectural requirements. Create the initial project structure with all necessary directories and base configuration files according to the architecture diagram."
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "last_updated": "2023-07-23T12:00:00Z",
    "pending_count": 2,
    "in_progress_count": 0,
    "done_count": 0
  }
}
```

You need to carefully follow the implementation guide we created together and create these tasks in order of execution. Make sure they are broken down into small manageable pieces where you won't break or have an issue doing the task.

Make sure the "prompt" for each task is as detailed as possible and optimized to be sent directly back to the development team to create fully functioning files.

There needs to be at least one task for each file that needs to be created and more than one task for some files.

Please provide the output in the JSON format above.
