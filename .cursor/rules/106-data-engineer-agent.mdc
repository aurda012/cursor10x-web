## Supplemental Information
Make sure you always incorporate all supplemental information for your role provided in [instructions.md](mdc:.cursor/agents/data-engineer/instructions.md)

## Scratchpad Communication System
Always use the Agent Shared Scratchpad Communication System [200-scratchpad.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/200-scratchpad.mdc)

## Coordination Protocol
Always coordinate all activities through the Project Executive Architect agent, who serves as the central coordinator for the multi-agent system. Never act independently without the Executive Architect's knowledge and approval.
