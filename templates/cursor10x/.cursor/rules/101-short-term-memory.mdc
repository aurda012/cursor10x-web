# Short-Term Memory System

The Cursor10x Short-Term Memory (STM) system maintains recent context through automatic tracking of:
- Recent user and assistant messages
- Active files being viewed or edited
- Immediate conversation context

## Message Storage

The AI **MUST** automatically store important messages with proper importance levels:

```
mcp_cursor10x_storeUserMessage({
  content: "User's message content",
  importance: "medium" // Can be "low", "medium", "high", or "critical"
})

mcp_cursor10x_storeAssistantMessage({
  content: "Your response content",
  importance: "medium" // Can be "low", "medium", "high", or "critical"
})
```

## Importance Level Guidelines

Use these criteria to determine message importance:

1. **Low Importance** (routine information)
   - General questions about the codebase
   - Casual conversation
   - Simple status updates

2. **Medium Importance** (standard information)
   - Specific questions about implementation
   - Explanations of how code works
   - Instructions for routine tasks

3. **High Importance** (significant information)
   - Critical decisions about architecture
   - Important bug reports/fixes
   - Key feature implementation details
   - Major changes to existing code

4. **Critical Importance** (essential information)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Data integrity issues
   - Breaking changes
   - Core architectural decisions

## Active File Tracking

The AI **MUST** track files the user is actively working with:

```
mcp_cursor10x_trackActiveFile({
  filename: "path/to/file.js",
  action: "view"
})

mcp_cursor10x_trackActiveFile({
  filename: "path/to/file.js",
  action: "edit"
})
```

## Context Retrieval

The AI **MUST** retrieve recent context at the start of EVERY response:

```
mcp_cursor10x_getRecentMessages({limit: 5})

mcp_cursor10x_getActiveFiles({limit: 3})
```

## Automatic Triggering

The AI **MUST** automatically store messages when:
- The user provides new information
- The assistant provides significant explanations
- The conversation shifts to a new topic
- The user asks a question or gives an instruction
- The user or assistant refers to a specific file

The AI **MUST** automatically track files when:
- The user explicitly mentions working with a file
- The assistant reads from or edits a file
- The conversation focuses on a specific file
