Based on the above blueprint we just created, please help me design a detailed file/folder architecture diagram for the software development project. The diagram should:

1. Follow industry best practices for organization and efficiency.
2. Include every necessary folder and file required for the project, including configurations, source code, assets, documentation, tests, and any other relevant components.
3. Be structured to support scalability and maintainability for future development.
4. Clearly distinguish between frontend and backend components (if applicable).
5. Incorporate naming conventions that align with modern standards (e.g., kebab-case or camelCase for files).

Please ensure the structure is optimized for a project that uses the technology stack as outlined in the blueprint.
